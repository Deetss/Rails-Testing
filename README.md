# Rails Testing *(test?)*
#### This is a the code, and work for [Rails 5 Test Prescriptions](https://pragprog.com/book/nrtest3/rails-5-test-prescriptions).

## Notes:

* Use the TDD process to create and adjust your code’s design
in small, incremental steps.
* In a test-driven process, if it is difficult to write tests for a
feature, strongly consider the possibility that the design of
the underlying code needs to be changed
* Initializing objects is a good starting place for a TDD process.
Another good approach is to use the test to design what you
want a successful interaction of the feature to look like.
* When possible, write your tests to describe your code’s
behavior, not its implementation.
* Keeping your code as simple as possible allows you to focus
complexity on the areas that really need complexity.
* Choose your test data and test-variable names to make it
easy to diagnose failures when they happen. Meaningful
names and data that doesn’t overlap are helpful.
